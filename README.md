# Zybo Z7 Root Repository

## Zybo Z7-10 Pmod VGA Demo

### Description

This branch contains sources for the Zybo Z7-10 Pmod VGA Demo.

This project is a Vivado demo using the Zybo Z7-10's, Pmod Ports and the Pmod VGA written in VHDL.
The Pmod VGA is controlled by the Zybo Z7-10 through Pmod ports JC and JD.
When programmed onto the board, a bouncing box and many test pattern bars are displayed on a connected VGA monitor.
The screen resolution is configurable through HDL code.

### Git Navigation Information

For instructions on how to use this repository with git, and for additional documentation on the submodule and branch structures used, please visit [Digilent FPGA Demo Git Repositories](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/documents/git) on the Digilent Wiki. Note that use of git is not required to use this demo. Digilent recommends the use of project releases, for which instructions can be found in each demo wiki page, linked above.

To see other demos in this repository, see the master branch's [README](https://github.com/Digilent/Zybo-Z7).

Some demos do not require some submodules, in these cases, they are still provided to ease switching between demos in git. When unused, the submodule folder is largely empty, except for a readme containing only the heading "Root commit". This demo contains the following submodules:

| Submodule | Used by this demo |
|-----------|-------------------|
| HW        | Yes          |
| OS        | No         |
| SW        | No         |
